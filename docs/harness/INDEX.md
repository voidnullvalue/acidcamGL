# Documentation Harness Index

This directory is a scaffold for future documentation generation.

## Generation Plan
- Batch tracking: BATCH_004 completed of 84 total; next is BATCH_005.
- Coverage counts: 32 / 555 active files documented (best-effort).
- Skipped files: 997 deferred in low-priority/vendor-like paths (see BATCH_PLAN.md).
- Uncertain areas: cross-file call graphs are best-effort and may be incomplete.

## Documents
- [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Build and Run](./BUILD_AND_RUN.md)
- [File Map](./FILE_MAP.md)
